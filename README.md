A WebExtension that replaces words and expressions in subtitles.

## Installing

*Work in progress...*

## How it works

It intercepts requests to the subtitle and replaces the expressions. It does almost
the same thing as the stream filter example in MDN web docs.

## Compatibility

It only works in Firefox, because it's the only browser that supports
[request filtering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/filterResponseData),
and at the moment it only works in [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/).

If you want other websites to be supported please send a pull request.
